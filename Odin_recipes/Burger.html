    <h2><strong>How to Make Basic Beef Burger Patties</strong></h2>
        <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties:</p>
        <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.</p>
        <p>Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul><li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>    
        <ol><li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
            <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
