    <h2><strong>What is Asado?</strong></h2>

    <p>Simply put, <strong>Asado is the Uruguayan version of barbequing!</strong> Meat, cheeses, and/or vegetables cooked over a wood fire then served alongside some tasty side dishes!</p>
        
    <p>Do I have a wood fire? No. But I did what I could to simulate one on my charcoal grill and got some seriously tasty results. Meat is delish on its own, but grilling it on the old bee-bee-cue with a little hickory thrown into the mix made my taste buds sing praises. Kinda like this except not so awkward. HIL.AR.IOUS.</p>

    <h2><strong>Asado Recibe</strong></h2>
   <p>Making this meat is pretty speedy and super yummy! Here’s everything you’ll need to make it:</p>
   <Ul><li><strong>Skirt Steak </strong>– I used a 2-pound skirt steak from my local grocery store, and that was enough to feed 4 people. So plan accordingly!</li>
        <li><strong>Canola Oil</strong>– this is to help the steak not stick to the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>– season to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Oregano</strong>– optional but adds some flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic </strong> – also optional, adds flavor, don’t forget to season both sides!</li>
        <li><strong>Hickory Wood Chips</strong>– this isn’t our typical food ingredient but you’ll need some of these Hickory Wood Chips if you’re going for the flavor I’ve outlined above.</li>

    <h2><strong>How to make Asado</strong></h2>
    <ol><li>The magic starts with <strong>Hickory wood chips.</strong> Throw these onto your hot charcoal and let ’em burn down a few minutes before grilling.</li>
        <li>While the grill is getting hot, brush some <strong>skirt steak with some</strong> canola oil. Both sides, please.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on some <strong>pepper</strong> and if you’re feeling spicy, throw on a little <strong>oregano and/or garlic.</strong></li>
        <li>Place your meat over your hot grill and <strong>cook 3-5 minutes per side…</strong> after about 2 minutes, <strong>sprinkle with as much salt as you’d like.</strong> Salt dries food out, so we only salt it on the grill. That’s something pretty Uruguayan… right?</li>
        <li>Once your meat is done, <strong>remove it from the grill and cover with foil. Rest 10-15 minutes </strong>and then slice as thin as you can.</li>
